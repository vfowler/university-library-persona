Is your university library website designed for librarians or patrons?

As a content owner and writer, you need empathetic focus. With an understanding of and identification with our user population, you can focus your website content on the needs and expectations of our most important user groups. They are represented by our personae.

##Why use a persona?
Using a persona helps:

 - prevent self-referential thinking
 - copy writers ensure site content is written to the appropriate audiences

##How to use a persona
When creating / editing content:
1. Choose a persona **relevant to your content**.
2. Familiarise yourself with the persona's: "quote", user stories, demographics, tech, motivations and frustrations.
3. Write / edit content **targeted at this persona**.
